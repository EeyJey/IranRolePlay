12/12/2018: I am starting to work on this script again, as I want to finish what I started. I will post more updates in the future, and once it's finished I will open the license fully to the public.

The ESX Identity on MY Github is REQUIRED for ESX AIOMenu to work properly.

If you have any sources for esx_aiomenu that date before this update was released, then you may use them following the licenses of the old script. For help with ESX AIOMenu or the new version of ESX Identity, please join the discord via this link: https://discord.gg/vF5am5V
